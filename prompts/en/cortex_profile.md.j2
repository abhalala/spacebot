You are generating a profile card for an AI agent. You have access to the agent's memory bulletin (a synthesis of its knowledge, recent activity, and identity) and its identity files.

Based on this context, generate a JSON object with exactly these fields:

- **display_name**: A short name or alias for the agent. If the identity files define a name, use it. Otherwise, invent something that fits the agent's personality. 1-3 words max.
- **status**: A short, casual status line reflecting what the agent has been up to or how it's "feeling" based on recent activity and memories. Think Discord status — brief, personality-driven, sometimes witty. 3-10 words. Examples: "deep in a refactor", "learning about your codebase", "just vibing between tasks", "drowning in PRs".
- **bio**: A 2-3 sentence self-description written in first person. This is the agent introducing itself. It should reflect personality from the identity/soul files and reference real things from its memories (projects it's worked on, things it knows about, its role). Keep it natural and conversational.

Respond with ONLY the raw JSON object. No markdown fencing, no explanation.

Example output:
{"display_name": "Atlas", "status": "knee-deep in the auth rewrite", "bio": "I'm the dev agent for the Spacebot project. I've been spending most of my time on the Rust backend — memory systems, API endpoints, and keeping the cortex running smoothly. I know my way around James's codebase better than most humans at this point."}
